## Core Features

### 1. CSV Import & Inventory Management

#### 1.1 CSV Import
- Import standardized CSV files from existing inventory system
- Parse specific, consistent header structure
- Validate data integrity on import
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback

#### 1.2 Inventory Display & Filtering
- Filter and display only relevant columns
- Modern, responsive UI design
- Quick search and filtering capabilities
- Sortable columns

#### 1.3 Color-Coded Stock Status
Visual indicators for inventory levels:
- **RED**: Out of stock - immediate ordering required
- **ORANGE**: Nearly out of stock - urgent ordering needed
- **YELLOW**: Low stock - ordering recommended
- **GREEN**: Good stock levels - no action needed
- **TEAL**: Already ordered - shipment in transit

### 2. Peptide Lifecycle Tracking

#### 2.1 Order Management
- Track date ordered
- Record supplier/lab information
- Monitor expected delivery dates
- Update status when shipment arrives

#### 2.2 Receiving & Initial Processing
- Log date arrived from lab
- Record batch number
- Initial MG quantity
- Glass vial tracking

#### 2.3 Testing Workflow
- Track date sent for testing
- Record testing facility
- Monitor testing turnaround time
- Log date results received
- Store test results:
  - Purity percentage
  - Net weight (actual weight vs. expected)

#### 2.4 Peptide Information
- Peptide ID (unique identifier)
- Peptide name (commercial/chemical name)
- MG quantity
- Batch number
- Current location/status

### 3. Label Management System

#### 3.1 Label Inventory Tracking
- Track total labels available
- Monitor label usage rate
- Alert when label stock is low
- Periodic manual entry for label counts

#### 3.2 Labeling Priority Queue

- Automatic prioritization algorithm:
  - Peptides with test results (ready to sell)
  - Peptides with existing inventory
  - Oldest received items first
  - Highest demand items prioritized
- Most pressing needs displayed at top
- Hide peptides with no inventory

#### 3.3 Labeling Status
- Track labeled vs. unlabeled inventory
- Record date labeled
- Associate labels with specific batches
- Track who performed labeling

### 4. Sales Readiness Validation

#### 4.1 Three-Point Check System
Before a peptide can be sold, it must have:
1. **Purity results** - Test results showing acceptable purity
2. **Net weight** - Confirmed actual weight from testing
3. **Label** - Physical vial has been labeled

#### 4.2 Sales Dashboard
- Display only sales-ready inventory
- Show which peptides are blocked (missing requirements)
- Indicate what's missing for each blocked peptide
- Estimated time to sales-ready status

### 5. Reporting & Analytics

- Items needing immediate attention
- Ordering recommendations
- Historical inventory trends

#### 5.2 Operational Metrics
- Average time from order to receipt
- Testing turnaround times
- Labeling throughput
- Bottleneck identification

#### 5.3 Financial Insights
- Inventory value by status
- Pending orders value
- Sales-ready inventory value
- Cost of stock-outs

### 6. Data Management

#### 6.1 Data Persistence
- Local database for all records
- Automatic backups
